This code is really helpful
Usage: 

Enter the title: This is the code
Enter the main message: HI
Do you want to have this event take place today or tmmr?: today
Enter the time and the time of day exp.(09:45pm):3:35pm
15:35

This is what you will encounter when running this code

Requirements: 

Up to date:

1. win32api
2. win32gui
3. sys
4. os
5. struct
6. time
7. schedule

If something is not up to date or not installed:
python -m pip install (whatever)

Not working:

Make sure there are no spaced in between the time and the am or pm
Make sure you spelled tmmr or tomorrow correct
The content in the main msg and the title will not matter

If all else fails and something is not working please leave it in the issue's tab and I will be sure to keep you updated as soon as possible!
